"""
The targetList is a list that combines several other lists. These lists include:

1. dueDateList: Contains phrases related to due dates.
2. gradesList: Contains percentages from 1% to 100%. These represent possible grades or weights for assignments.
3. assignmentsList: Contains phrases related to assignments.
4. examsList: Contains phrases related to exams.

The targetList is used to filter words in a document. Any word that matches an item in the targetList is considered a "target word". These target words are used for further processing, such as generating a weekly schedule for students.
